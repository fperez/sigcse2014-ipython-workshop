**Abstract:**
The [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is an interactive browser-based environment
where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots, and rich media into a single document.
Originally designed for use as an electronic lab notebook for computational science,
it is increasingly being used in teaching as well,
and a rich ecosystem of open source plugins and extensions for teaching is growing around it.
The first half of this hands-on workshop will introduce the Notebook
and present examples of lessons and instructional materials built around it.
In the second half,
attendees will explore future directions for the Notebook as a teaching platform.

**Intended audience:**
Instructors at post-secondary institutions;
anyone interested in computational science education;
researchers and tool builders interested in exploring a new platform for their work.

**Presenter Biographies:**

*Greg Wilson* is the director of Software Carpentry,
a volunteer organization that teaches basic programming skills
to researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related fields.
He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh,
and presently works for the Mozilla Foundation.

*Fernando Perez*
is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley;
he started the IPython project in 2001 and continues to lead its
development.  He holds a PhD in physics from the University of Colorado.

*Peter Norvig*
is Director of Research at Google Inc.
and co-author of a widely-used textbook on artificial intelligence.
He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of California Berkeley.

We expect at least three other presenters to attend,
depending on scheduling.
All will have in-class experience teaching with the IPython Notebook,
and will share their experiences and materials.

**Materials Provided:**
Each participant will be expected to download and install
one of the "batteries included" scientific Python distributions produced by Enthought and Continuum Analytics
(both of which are available free of charge).
During the workshop,
we will help participants install some or all of these plugins
(so that they have hands-on experience with the setup and configuration process):

* "skimage.novice, which is modeled on the multimedia library developed by Mark Guzdial and others at Georgia Tech.
* "ipythonblocks, which allows learners to explore loops, conditionals, and similar basic concepts using grids of colored cells.
* "regexmagic, which supports direct manipulation of regular expressions and their results.

We will also provide lesson materials developed by the Software Carpentry project,
Drs. Norvig and Perez,
and others for attendees to explore and critique.

**Rough Agenda:**

1. Installation and configuration: 15 minutes.
   (Attendees should do this before arrival, but there are inevitably some issues for some people.)
2. Introducing the IPython Notebook: 30 minutes.
3. Sample lesson #1: 15 minutes.
   One of the presenters will speed-teach an introduction to dictionaries in Python using the Notebook.
4. Sample lesson #2: 15 minutes.
   Another present will speed-teach a simple problem in statistics
   to illustrate the Notebook's use as an electronic lab notebook.
5. Coffee break: 15 minutes.
6. Plugins: 30 minutes.
   The presenters will show how to install and configure plugins,
   and demonstrate several that are particularly relevant to teaching.
7. Discussion and feedback: 60 minutes.
   Having spent two hours teaching, the presenters will become the learners.
   What do attendees think are the Notebook's strengths and weaknesses?
   How does it compare to other teaching platforms?
   What ideas or materials that have proven their worth elsewhere could be adapted for use with the Notebook?
   What *isn't* the Notebook suitable for teaching?

**Audio/Visual and Computer Requirements:**
Participants must have wireless internet access and laptop power at each seat throughout the workshop.
We will also need a digital projector (for presenters)
and a flipchart with pens (for publicly recording small-group critiques).

**Laptop Required:**
all participants will need a laptop.

**Space and Enrollment Restrictions:**
Enrollment should be limited to 40 participants to ensure interactivity.

**Other Critical Information:**
None.
